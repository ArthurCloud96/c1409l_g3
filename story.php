            <h1 class= "aat" >Story of Ahmad Tea</h1>
            <p><h3>
                Ahmad Tea is a UK-based family business, drawing on four generations of tea blending and tasting experience. Founded on a passion for the finest tea, we are dedicated to the unique place that tea drinking commands at the heart of daily life in Britain and beyond.
                <br />
                <br />
                When the company was established in England, we felt that people desired an exceptional infusion which could be enjoyed every day. The selection of our first plantations and partners, our initial blending and tasting, and even our early packaging – all were driven by a commitment to meet this need. To this end, we were also one of the first companies to present tea in ways that emphasised its worth, offering it in beautiful gift packs, exquisite tins and charming caddies.
                <br />
                <br />
Over the years, as our reputation grew and our reach spread, it became equally obvious that people throughout the world shared this desire for a cup of tea that was much more than simply refreshment, but an enjoyable, memorable and satisfying experience. Such international recognition of the quality of our teas has grown to the extent that we now export to over 80 countries on six continents.

                <br />
                <br />

Early in the life of Ahmad Tea, our Managing Director promised, “I will not sell anything that I would not drink at home.” This refusal to accept anything but the finest teas – primarily in terms of their flavour, aroma, colour, strength and consistency, but also in their image, branding and packaging – continues to guide our tasters and inspire our entire company.

                <br />
                <br />
Ahmad Tea is renowned for the quality of its teas across the globe, and yet remains a family business, true to the vision that founded it.
